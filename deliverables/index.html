</table><h2>Deliverables and Tasks</h2>
<h3>Product Requirements Document (PRD):</h3>
<p>After firming up the project idea, each team will be required to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document">Product Requirements Document (PRD)</a> that details all the various aspects of your project. It is written to allow stakeholders to understand what a product should do, and also allow serve as a guiding document for the team that is building the product.</p>
<p>PRD should include a one paragraph summary of the project (summarize your project proposal), deliverables (what are you going to deliver at the end), the features (ranked by priority), any performance metrics, milestones, responsibilities of each team member, materials and outside help needed, budget, risks, and how risks will be addressed. You will be asked to do this early on and we will evaluate your progress against your PRD over the span of the course. Your PRD should be on your website.</p>
<p>PRD template: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-edmIo2r76U26u1LWQ-F1NgwDwTYz-pmisIQ1l40QIA/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-edmIo2r76U26u1LWQ-F1NgwDwTYz-pmisIQ1l40QIA/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<h3>Code Reviews:</h3>
<p>Each team will be required to post weekly project snippets to their webpage detailing updates to the project. The teaching staff will use these project snippets to perform code reviews for each team. The structure of the weekly project snippet should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 1 sentence description of what each team member worked on</li>
<li>A bulleted list of new features/functionality implemented</li>
<li>A bulleted list of specific files the team would like to have reviewed</li>
<li>A bulleted list of blocking issues or other help needed</li>
</ol>
<h3>Peer reviews</h3>
<p>You will be conducting two teammate group peer reviews during mid-quarter and end-quarter. This will involve giving demos of your work to other teams and gathering feedback.</p>
<h3>Project Webpage for each team:</h3>
<p>Each team is required to create a webpage that will include all the material created throughout the quarter. Every deliverable will be linked from your webpage. Teams will create their websites through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. The style should be like on Kickstarter, (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scanse/sweep-scanning-lidar?ref=category">Example</a>). Keep the website simple so it easy for us to navigate.</p>
<p>Make sure to document everything and put it on the website (notes, pictures, videos, etc), and send us the link that we can add to the course webpage.</p>
<p>Please setup your website by Friday, January 14, 23:59 (11:59pm), and send a link to vr-capstone-staff@cs. Initially, the website can contain a your initial project proposals (+any slides you used, &amp; incorporating feedback/updates) and a short bio/background of the team members. You can update and improve your website as the quarter progresses.</p>
<p>This website will eventually have several components:</p>
<p>Quick description of your project</p>
<ul>
<li>A short bio/background of the team members</li>
<li>A link to your PRD</li>
<li>A hype/demo video (later on in the quarter)</li>
<li>Weekly updates on progress as project snippets</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some example (final) project websites from previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://uwrealitylab.github.io/xrcapstone21sp-team7/index.html">Website Example 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://uwrealitylab.github.io/vrcapstone20sp-team5/">Website Example 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://uwrealitylab.github.io/vrcapstone20sp-team3/">Website Example 3</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Demo Video</h3>
<p>Create a video that presents what your app should accomplish (or what challenge it is trying to solve), the capabilities of your app and an example of how it is played or used (like the one you're going to demo during the final session). The videos are going to be played during the demo session and placed on your websites. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUrnEzq_q60&list=PL8bmgwX9eBPGjM7NuYWPFbXIGKenRAg4Y">Examples of past videos</a>. The videos can be approximately 1 minute long. Can include narration (kickstarter style) or just demonstrate technical features of your project.</p>
<h3>Demo Plan and Rehersal</h3>
<p>You will be required to come up with a demo plan, that includes the floor-plan layout for your space, any furniture/props and some sinage for the team project. You will also need to prepare a demo 'script' and reherse the script in the Lab, a week prior to the final demo day.</p>
<h3>Demo Day</h3>
<p>The final demo day will take place either in person or on Zoom (depending on the current health situation) tentatively on Monday, March 14. There will be a rehearsal, one week prior. Mark your calendars now! More details will be sent later in the quarter as they are confirmed.</p>
<p>It will be very exciting, fun, and a fitting end to the capstone! It will be open to friends, family and general public. We will also invite a number of guests from companies like Microsoft, Magic Leap, Google, Meta, Valve, and more!</p>
<p>Staff will evaluate final demos on Novelty, Difficulty, Production Value, Final Demo, Presentation.</p>
<h3>After the Capstone Ends</h3>
<p>Your course related obligations end after demo day. However, some teams may choose to continue working on their capstone project in order to release it on the App Store, Open Source, etc. This is a great way to get your creations out into the world and gain recognition for your work! If your team would like to continue working on the project, please contact the course staff and we will be happy to help you!</p>
